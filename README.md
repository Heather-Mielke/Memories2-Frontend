## What is the application?

Image is an application that allows users to add photos to a board for others to see, like, and eventually comment. This application is full CRUD so users can create, read, update and delete any post. There is an expand option on the images which allows users to see descriptions made by the creator of what the image is or what it represents. Users are also able to search directly on the discover page.

## The challenges

The challenges I faced in this application was getting a grasp of Redux. After spending many hours/days playing with it, I do see the benifits and believe I can get comfortable with it in time.

Another challenge I had was user authentication. This was a goal intended for the application that ended up causing my issues so was scrapped for the time being.

## Future Plans

My future plans for this project is to get user authentication going as well as the ability to leave comments on others posts. Also potentially a photo editing feature.
